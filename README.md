# Photodiode calibration project

Goal of the project is to calibrate the photodiodes. For that purpose, there are two set-ups. The first is used to obtain the power W-V relationship thanks to the two beams after the beamsplitter. In this way, we know what power we expect to be reaching the PD, so that we can calibrated. The calibration of the PD is done thanks to the Rasberry. Note that in the data columns, we will either have PowerMeter+Keithley or Raspberry(PD)+Keithley. The second setup, the laser goes through the BS, and reached the PD and the sensors in the baffle. In this way, we have a relative change of the PD (V) with the power in the sensors (seen as ADC counts). With these two relationships, we can obtained the final calibration factor, that is given in ADC counts/W per each sensor.
